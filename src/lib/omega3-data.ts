      "Omega 3 fatty acids are essential fats that the body cannot produce on its own. The most important Omega 3s are EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid) and DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid), which play a vital role in heart health, brain function, joint health, inflammation control, and muscle recovery."

      "Omega 3 is anti-inflammatory and essential. Omega 6 is also essential but already overconsumed in Indian diets and becomes inflammatory when excessive. Omega 9 is non-essential as the body can produce it. Omega 3 intake should always be prioritized."
