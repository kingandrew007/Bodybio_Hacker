      "Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is a fat-soluble vitamin that works more like a hormone in the body. It plays a key role in bone strength, muscle function, immunity, hormone balance, and recovery. Your body naturally produces Vitamin D3 when your skin is exposed to sunlight — but modern lifestyles make this increasingly difficult."

  },
  {
    type: "text",
    content:
      "Even with plenty of sunlight, Vitamin D3 deficiency is extremely common in India due to indoor work culture, air pollution blocking UVB rays, darker skin pigmentation (which requires more sun exposure to synthesize D3), sunscreen use, very few natural food sources, and lack of routine supplementation. Many Indians have low or borderline D3 levels without knowing it."

      "Vitamin D3 is essential for proper calcium absorption, strong bones and teeth, muscle contraction and strength, immunity and inflammation control, hormonal balance including testosterone, and overall energy levels and recovery. Low D3 can cause fatigue, muscle weakness, joint pain, poor recovery, and frequent illness."

      "Natural sources of Vitamin D3 include sunlight exposure for 15–30 minutes on arms and legs during midday, fatty fish such as salmon and sardines, egg yolks, fortified milk and dairy products, and cod liver oil. Diet alone is usually not enough to fix deficiency."

      "General adults require around 600–800 IU per day. Most Indians benefit from 1000–2000 IU daily for maintenance. Deficient individuals are often prescribed higher therapeutic doses under medical guidance. A blood test measuring 25-OH Vitamin D is the most accurate way to know your status."
