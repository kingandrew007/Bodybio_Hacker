    question: "Do I need to cycle creatine?",

  {
    type: "story_qa",
    question: "Does creatine cause water retention?",
    answer: "Yes, but inside muscles (intramuscular water retention), which is a GOOD thing. It improves muscle volume, hydration, and visible size. It does not cause subcutaneous (under the skin) bloating."
  },
  {
    type: "story_qa",
    question: "Can I take creatine with caffeine?",
    answer: "Yes. There is no real-world evidence that caffeine cancels out creatine's benefits. Many pre-workouts contain both successfully."
  },
  {

    question: "Is creatine safe long-term?",
    answer: "Yes. Studies spanning 5+ years have shown no adverse effects in healthy individuals. It is one of the safest supplements available."

  {
    type: "story_qa",
    question: "Do I need to drink excessive water?",
    answer: "Just stay normally hydrated using thirst as your guide. There is no need to drink gallons of water just because you are taking creatine."
